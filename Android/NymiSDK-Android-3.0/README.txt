RELEASE NOTES
--------
* API is only supported for Nymulator at the moment. We will be releasing support for Nymi Band shortly. Frequent updates to the SDK should be expected as this is a Beta version.
* Only one NEA can run at a time and communicate with the Nymulator.
* Previous version of Nymulators is not supported. Version 1.2 and above is supported.

--------
KNOWN ISSUES
--------
Issue 1: The Nymulator may fail in a manner that is not reported but which causes NymiAdapter to fail to initialize.
* Workaround 1: Restart your Nymulator instance.
* Workaround 2: Physically restart your Nymulator host

Only in rare cases should Workaround 2 be required.

Issue 2: In OSX, when a new xml file is loaded into the Nymulator, the current list of Nymi Bands are not properly cleared in the gui.
* Workaround: We suggest to start a fresh Nymulator when loading a new xml file.
