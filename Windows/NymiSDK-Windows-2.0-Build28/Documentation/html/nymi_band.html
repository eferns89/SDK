<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>The <b>Nymi band</b> provides individuals with persistent identity via authentication using a person's unique ECG. It comes with a companion application, the <b>Nymi Companion App</b> (NCA). The NCA is utilized by users to establish their identity on first use (enrollment) and for authentication on subsequent uses. Once the a wearer is authenticated, they remain authenticated as long as the device is worn by the same person.</p>
<p>The wearer can then identify themselves with <b>Nymi Enabled Applications</b> (NEAs) without the need for other credentials such as passwords.</p>
<p>Communication between the <b>Nymi band</b> and either the NCA or NEAs occurs through Bluetooth Low Engergy (BLE). On Windows based machines, an external BLE dongle is required, along with the correct drivers and the Nymi Bluetooth Service. A complementary dongle (BLED112, Bluegiga) is provided with each Nymi.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="nymiWearerID_sub"></a>
How the Nymi Band Identifies its Wearer</h1>
<h2>Enrollment and Authentication</h2>
<p>The <b>Nymi band</b> identifies wearers based on their electrocardiogram (ECG). When a user puts on their Nymi for the first time, a comprehensive ECG profile is created and saved, using the NCA. This process is named enrollment. The NCA is currently supported on Windows and OSX platforms.</p>
<p>The next time that the same user puts on the same <b>Nymi band</b>, ECG is captured and matched to the stored profile. This process is named authentication. Provided the newly captured ECG matches the ECG during enrollment, the <b>Nymi band</b> enters an authenticated state and becomes active. It remains in this state until it is removed from the wearer's wrist (either the band is cut, or the clasp is opened).</p>
<p>An unauthenticated Nymi cannot be used with NEAs and encrypts its internal data until it is successfully authenticated.</p>
<p>This process is handled by the NCA, which we provide.</p>
<h2>Enabling NEAs</h2>
<p><b>Nymi Enabled Applications</b> (NEAs) can be allowed to work with a particular <b>Nymi band</b> by the user. This process is known as provisioning.</p>
<p>A provision is a bridge between a NEA and a Nymi. After the bridge is established, the application can detect and communicate with the same Nymi in the future as long as that Nymi band is authenticated. Once a provision is established, it persists until the Nymi undergoes factory reset, or when the user opts out of the app using the Nymi Companion App. NEAs can only communicate with a Nymi band if it is authenticated.</p>
<p>An NEA can look for a previously provisioned Nymi through a process called validation. The validation process as a whole consists of first finding and then validating the Nymi Band. It allows the capability to determine the user profile that the Nymi Band was originally provisioned for and for using the Nymi band for application specific needs such as vibrating the Nymi band, using it to generate keys, etc.</p>
<p>It is a two step process depending on your application's use case. The first step is mandatory and requires your application to find the Nymi Band. This finding will result in a strong or weak boolean indicator to show if the original Nymi Band that was authorized by the NEA has been found. The strong boolean indicator is a quick way to confirm the Nymi Bandâ€™s identity. If a weak boolean indicator is received you will need to proceed to the second step.</p>
<p>The second step involves the <a class="el" href="group__negotiation_functions.html#ga7db0235691855d0590a9bc6e9e55496c">nclValidate</a> API callback. If your application needs the Nymi Band for more than determining the user profile (for example, to generate keys or to make the Nymi Band vibrate), your application will need to proceed to placing the <a class="el" href="group__negotiation_functions.html#ga7db0235691855d0590a9bc6e9e55496c">nclValidate</a> API callback which provides greater security and opens the communication channel to the Nymi Band.</p>
<p>Once the Nymi has been validated, application-specific behaviour can occur and data can be collected from the Nymi through the <b>Nymi Communications Library</b> (NCL) API calls. The only exception is <a class="el" href="group__security_functions.html#gaca668c6614f5e446c57d0c5e936fb01b">nclGlobalSign</a>, which does not require the Nymi to be validated. Developers must take care of both the provision and validation through a sequence of API calls. The API is provided via the <b>Nymi Communications Library</b> (NCL).</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="core_concepts.png" alt="core_concepts.png"/>
</div>
<p> The above diagram depicts the basic end user flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user enrolls with the NCA only once and creates a template.</li>
<li>The NCA is used to authenticate the user based on the ECG.<ul>
<li>Once authenticated, the band stays in authenticated state until it is removed from the wearer's wrist (either currting the band or opening the clasp).</li>
<li>A de-autenticated band must be authenticated again with the same NCA on which the profile was created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NEAs can be provisioned with authenticated Nymis.<ul>
<li>Provisioning only needs to happen only once for each NEA</li>
<li>The provision informaiton about the NEA is stored on the <b>Nymi band</b>. The NEA should store the provision returned from the band for future communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NEAs on subsequent usage validate against the provisioned <b>Nymi band</b>. Once validation is successful, the NEA can assume an authenticated user.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>The developer version of the Nymi bands can only be provisioned up to 6 times with NEA (Nymi Enabled Applications). To provision more than 6 times, you will need to delete the existing profile(s) for the band from the NCA (Nymi Companion App). This will enable the developer version of the Nymi band for authorization once more..</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="capabilities_sub"></a>
Capabilities of the Nymi</h1>
<p>The band provides a number of other other capabilities in addition to the the basic authentication. These capabilities are either security related or data generated by the <b>Nymi</b> band that can be used by the NEA.</p>
<p>The security related features allow NEAs to perform signature functions, general key pairs and pseudorandom numbers. These topics are covered more in the <a class="el" href="tutorial_security.html">Security Tutorial</a>.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="nymi_outputs.png" alt="nymi_outputs.png"/>
</div>
<p>The band can proivde the following data for use by an NEA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proximity through RSSI reading</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a class="el" href="group__streams.html">Streams</a> section of the Nymi Communication Library Reference contains functions for reading ECG data. <a class="el" href="group__misc_functions.html#gae33cfc37b1d399f37bcd95ab89f288f5">nclGetRssi</a> queries the Nymi for RSSI values.</p>
<h2>Notifications to the User</h2>
<p>A Nymi can provide feedback to the wearer in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual: there are 5 LED lights located on the side of the central housing</li>
<li>Haptic: there is a vibration motor located in the wristband</li>
</ul>
<p>The LED lights and the vibration motor are primarily used for built-in operations such as reporting the state of the Nymi. However, Nymi-Enabled Applications can use the haptic motor for simple notifications through <a class="el" href="group__misc_functions.html#ga815059336ba7599dca45d20958491171">nclNotify</a>. </p>
